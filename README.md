## A repository to store all examples related to a JUnit5 tech talk.

This code and talk is based  on **JUnit 5.0.0-M2** released on Jul 23 2016.

Use with **IntelliJ Platform 2016.2** (or higher) for JUnit5 support.

Otherwise please do some further reading on how to run the tests [here](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests).

This is based on a talk given by Nicolai Parlog at JAXLondon 2016.
